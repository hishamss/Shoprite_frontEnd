<h3>CI/CD Pipeline Using Jenkins</h3>

Below is the steps I used to setup the build pipeline:

- on EC2 instance, install npm, node and express
- install Jenkins on Tomcat server
- Enable webhook on github repository to trigger Jenkins build pipeline whenever new changes pushed to the main branch
- The pipeline stages include cleaning the public folder for express, run npm install, run npm build, and copy the new build folder to express public folder

<h3>Usage</h3>

- Admin/user login from the landing page
- Both admin and user can see the list of the available employees in the store, but only the admin is able to change their roles, delete them and add new employees
- If the user logout, he/she will be redirected to the landing page and his session will be removed from the cookies
